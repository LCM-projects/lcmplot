You need to have the lcm executables and libraries as well as matplotlib and
qt related things. I think lcm and qt comes with drake, you might need to
install matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

I have not tried to setup the python packages for the lcm message correctly..
For now, you need to set $BOT_CORE_LCMT_HOME to where bot_core's .lcm are, and
run ./gen-types.sh.

You can then start the plotter with:
python lcmplot.py example_log/val_standing_log

val_standing_log is a short log of simulated valkyrie standing controlled by
the qp controller in drake master.

The traces should be shown on the right side, double click to expand and
collapse. When you get to the leaf, you can right click to plot or remove
that trace.
The radio buttons are some kind of subplot selectors. Plotting and removing
traces operates on the subplot.
